## [Failure Prediction with Statistical Guarantees for Vision-Based Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05894.pdf)

This repository contains code for running many of the experiments and results from the paper. We include all algorithms and pretrained weights for failure predictors. 
- `./obstacle_avoidance`: for training failure predictors in the obstacle avoidance with vision-based drone example
- `./conformal_prediction`: for demonstrating the comformal prediction style guarantees

See each folder's readme for further details.
